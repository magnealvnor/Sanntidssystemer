1 AVR32 GPIO demo help

The GPIO demo requires a LED to be wired to the AT32AP7000 device. This will
be different from board to board.

The demo is based on the gpio_leds driver in the kernel, expecting to find a
/sys/class/leds directory with defined LEDs. The default kernel configuration
will take care of this.


2 Setup for AVR32 boards

2.1 ATSTK1002

Connect J2 on GPIO to J20 RGB.

2.2 ATNGW100

No connectiong is needed since LED A is directly wired to the device.
